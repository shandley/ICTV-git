==================================================

Analysis Date: 2025-06-09T20:58:51.940106
Data Source: ICTV Master Species List host data and taxonomic changes

Key Findings:
  - primary_correlation: r = 0.989 (positive correlation)
  - interpretation: Broader host range associated with lower taxonomic stability
  - average_changes: 12.7
  - most_stable_category: Ultra-specialist viruses
  - least_stable_category: Ultra-generalist viruses
  - host_jumping_effect: Major driver of taxonomic instability

Statistical Summary:
  - families_analyzed: 10
  - total_taxonomic_changes: 127
  - correlation_strength: Strong correlation
  - case_studies_examined: 4

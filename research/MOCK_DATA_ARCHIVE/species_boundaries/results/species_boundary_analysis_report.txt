SPECIES BOUNDARY EVOLUTION ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================

## Executive Summary
Analysis of species demarcation criteria across 10 viral families from 2005-2024
reveals a fundamental shift from phenotypic to genotypic classification methods.

## Key Findings

### 1. Classification Method Evolution
2005 Methods:
  - serology: 1 families
  - mixed: 4 families
  - genomic: 2 families
  - serological: 1 families
  - morphological: 1 families
  - phylogenetic: 1 families

2024 Methods:
  - genomic: 7 families
  - phylogenetic: 2 families
  - DISCONTINUED: 1 families

### 2. Threshold Evolution Patterns
- Increasing stringency: 3 families
- Stable thresholds: 2 families
- Decreasing stringency: 0 families

### 3. Major Evolutionary Trends

Phenotype to Genotype Shift:
  - Magnitude: 6 families â†’ 9 families
  - 90.0% now use genetic methods

Threshold Refinement:

Multi-marker Adoption:
  - Magnitude: 9 families use multiple markers

### 4. Technology-Driven Changes

High-throughput sequencing (2010-2015):
  - Impact: Enabled whole-genome comparisons

Phylogenetic software advances (2015-2020):
  - Impact: Sophisticated tree-building and distance calculations

Metagenomics (2020-2024):
  - Impact: Discovery of viruses without cultivation

### 5. Notable Family-Specific Patterns
- Papillomaviridae: Remarkably stable L1 gene criterion (90%) for 20 years
- Coronaviridae: Complete methodology overhaul post-COVID
- Bacteriophages: Morphology abandoned entirely for phylogeny
- Picornaviridae: Threshold increased from 70% to 88% identity

## Summary Statistics
- Families analyzed: 10
- Total criteria changes: 20
- Average changes per family: 2.0

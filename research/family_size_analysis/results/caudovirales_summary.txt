CAUDOVIRALES DISSOLUTION: LARGEST VIRAL TAXONOMY REORGANIZATION
================================================================================
Year: 2021 (MSL36)
Scale: 1,847 species affected
Structure Change: 3 → 15 families

BEFORE (Morphology-based classification):
  Order: Caudovirales
  ├── Family: Myoviridae (contractile tail)
  ├── Family: Siphoviridae (long non-contractile tail)
  └── Family: Podoviridae (short tail)

AFTER (Phylogeny-based classification):
  15 new families based on molecular relationships:
    • Drexlerviridae
    • Demerecviridae
    • Salasmaviridae
    • Guelinviridae
    • Zierdtviridae
    • Kyanoviridae
    • Vertoviridae
    • Straboviridae
    • ... and 7 more families

SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE:
  Phylogenetic analysis showed the three families were not monophyletic

IMPACT:
  ✅ Better reflects evolutionary relationships
  ✅ Resolves paraphyletic groupings
  ✅ Provides clearer host-virus associations
  ⚠️ Required extensive database updates
  ⚠️ Disrupted existing literature references

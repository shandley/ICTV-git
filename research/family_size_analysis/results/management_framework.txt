FAMILY SIZE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
============================================================
Evidence-based guidelines for viral taxonomy management

SIZE ZONES AND ACTIONS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Range        Zone            Action Required               
------------------------------------------------------------
0-50         🔴 TOO SMALL     Insufficient for comparative studies
50-300       🟢 OPTIMAL       Ideal for management and research
300-500      🟡 REVIEW        Monitor phylogeny, consider subfamilies
500-1000     🟠 ACTION        Reorganization likely needed  
1000+        🔴 CRISIS        Immediate attention required  

REAL EXAMPLE - CAUDOVIRALES:
  Before: ~1,847 species (CRISIS ZONE)
  Action: Split into 15 families
  After: Families average 50-150 species (OPTIMAL ZONE)

BEST PRACTICES:
  • Regular phylogenetic review when family exceeds 300 species
  • Consider subfamily creation before family splitting
  • Maintain monophyletic groupings as primary criterion
  • Document splitting rationale in formal proposals

CONTEXT: 14.8x species growth requires proactive management

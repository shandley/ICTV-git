#### Mathematical Validation:
- **Optimal Family Size**: 1-5 species (100% achieve >9.5 stability scores)
- **Crisis Threshold**: >100 species per family (100% reorganization rate)
- **Generalist Penalty**: Ultra-generalist viruses experience 3.7x more taxonomic changes
- **Complexity Cost**: Non-linear increase in instability with complexity growth

### 3. **Successful Bias Correction Framework**

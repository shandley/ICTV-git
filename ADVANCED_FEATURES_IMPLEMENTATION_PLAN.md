## Feature 1: Natural Language Query Interface

### Architecture
```
User Query → LLM Intent Parser → Query Translator → Git/DB Query → Result Formatter → Natural Response
```

### Core Components

#### 1.1 Query Intent Parser
```python
class QueryIntentParser:
    """Extract structured intent from natural language"""
    
    def parse(self, query: str) -> QueryIntent:
        # Examples:
        # "What happened to phage lambda?" → track_history
        # "Show me unstable coronaviruses" → find_unstable
        # "Which viruses infect both plants and animals?" → cross_host
```

#### 1.2 Supported Query Types
- **Historical**: Track species through time
- **Stability**: Find volatile classifications
- **Similarity**: Find related viruses
- **Host-based**: Query by host organism
- **Genomic**: Query by genome features
- **Geographic**: Query by discovery location
- **Temporal**: Query by time periods

#### 1.3 Implementation Milestones
- [ ] Week 3: Basic query parsing with 10 query types
- [ ] Week 4: Git query translation layer
- [ ] Week 5: Streamlit chat interface
- [ ] Week 6: Response formatting and testing

## Feature 2: AI Classification Suggestions

### Training Data Preparation
```python
# Extract all reclassification events
reclassifications = extract_reclassifications_from_git()
# ~727 unstable species with full history

# Create feature vectors
features = {
    'genome_features': encode_genome_sequences(),
    'blast_similarity': calculate_similarity_matrices(),
    'host_info': encode_host_metadata(),
    'morphology': encode_morphological_data(),
    'discovery_context': encode_temporal_spatial_data()
}
```

### Model Architecture
```
Input Features → Transformer Encoder → Classification Head → Confidence Estimator
                                    ↓
                            Red Flag Detector → Warnings
```

### Key Algorithms

#### 2.1 Stability Scorer
```python
def calculate_family_stability(family_name: str) -> float:
    """Score 0-1 indicating classification stability"""
    # Factors:
    # - Historical reclassification frequency
    # - Recent paper trends
    # - Phylogenetic coherence
    # - Number of species
```

#### 2.2 Confidence Calibration
- Use temperature scaling for honest confidence scores
- Validate on held-out reclassification events
- Target: 90% accuracy when confidence > 0.8

#### 2.3 Implementation Milestones
- [ ] Week 7: Training data preparation
- [ ] Week 8: Feature engineering pipeline
- [ ] Week 9: Model training and validation
- [ ] Week 10: API endpoint and testing

2. **RefSeq** (Curated subset)
3. **UniProt** (Protein-focused)
4. **BOLD** (Barcode sequences)
5. **EBI Taxonomy** (European hub)

### Sync Architecture
```
ICTV-git → Mismatch Detector → Correction Generator → Submission Queue
    ↑                                                          ↓
    └──────── Update Tracker ← Database APIs ← Automated Submitter
```

### Implementation Components

#### 3.1 Mismatch Detection
```python
class MismatchDetector:
    async def scan_database(self, db_name: str):
        # Stream through all viral entries
        # Compare with current ICTV classification
        # Flag mismatches with severity scores
```

#### 3.2 Correction Templates

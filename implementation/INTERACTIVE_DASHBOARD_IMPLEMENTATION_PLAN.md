```

### Key Technical Components

#### 1. **Real-Time Risk Engine**
```python
@st.cache_data
def calculate_risk_with_params(family_data, weights, thresholds):
    """Recalculate family risks with custom parameters."""
    # Real-time risk calculation with user-defined weights
    return updated_assessments

def risk_parameter_controls():
    """Streamlit sidebar controls for risk parameters."""
    st.sidebar.header("Risk Assessment Parameters")
    size_weight = st.sidebar.slider("Family Size Weight", 0.0, 1.0, 0.3)
    # Additional parameter controls...
```

#### 2. **Interactive Visualization Components**
```python
def interactive_risk_matrix(assessments, selected_families):
    """Create interactive Plotly risk assessment matrix."""
    fig = px.scatter(
        hover_data=['family_name', 'risk_score', 'intervention_type'],
        color='risk_category',
        size='growth_rate'
    )
    return st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)
```

#### 3. **Dynamic Data Management**
```python
def family_data_editor():
    """Editable family data interface."""
    edited_data = st.data_editor(
        family_database,
        column_config={
            "current_size": st.column_config.NumberColumn(min_value=1),
            "growth_rate": st.column_config.NumberColumn(min_value=0.0, max_value=1.0)
        }
    )
    return edited_data
```
